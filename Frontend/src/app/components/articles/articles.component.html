        <h1>Adhocracy culture</h1>
        <p>
        The name of this type of culture comes from the word “ad-hoc”, which describes this culture type’s tendency to take risks in order to innovate and move quickly. Most start-up and tech companies have this type of culture so they can create without too many barriers and be the first to market. This type of culture is usually high-energy and agile. Silicon Valley companies like Facebook, Google, etc. tend to have Adhocracy cultures.

      <h3>Clan culture</h3>
      <p>Think new, young companies or small, family-owned companies. The name “clan culture” comes from the “clan” mentality of these cultures, where everyone thinks and feels similarly, and are working toward a common goal. Employees are a top priority, and there’s a large focus on collaboration and teamwork. Clan cultures foster fierce loyalty and a strong company identity. They are likely to use open and informal communication. What you won’t find here is a high number of management levels, as employees are seen as peers and family. 
          Tom’s of Maine, Chobani, and Redmond (Real Salt) have clan cultures.</p>

      <h3>Customer-focused culture</h3>
      <p>Southwest, Zappos, Nordstrom. Customer-focused cultures put customers first and empower their employees to do the same. These types of cultures often make the news for their exceptional customer service and loyalty.</p>

      <h3>Hierarchy culture</h3>
      <p>Hierarchy cultures are the traditional, paternalistic types of cultures. As the name suggests, leadership hierarchy, power, and processes are important. 
          These types of cultures can be risk-adverse and focus on preventing mistakes, sticking to rules and tradition, 
          and managing failure. High-risk organisations like those in the oil and gas, finance, healthcare, 
          and government industries often have hierarchy cultures.

      <h3>Market-driven culture</h3>
      <p> A market-driven culture is focused on getting to market. 
          This type of culture is results-oriented, hard-working, demanding, and highly competitive. 
          Companies with market-driven cultures may focus less on employee experience and satisfaction, 
          and more on performance and results. Tesla, Amazon, and Apple have this type of culture.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="item">
      <h3>Purpose-driven culture</h3>
      <p>These cultures are driven by, you guessed it, a strong purpose. Their culture is built on a defined, shared reason for being, and they attract employees, customers, 
          and partners who share those ideals. These types of cultures tend to be more 
          community-focused, collaborative, and charitable. Whole Foods, REI, and TOMS shoes are classic examples.</p>
